Significant work on both the board and AgOpenGPS Wiki's.

Release 5.7.0

Boards are firmware are here: https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS_Boards

Be sure to update your firmware with this release.

Don't think about it - just update to this version.

Release 5.6.2

Version 5.6.2 replaces 5.6 - The big change is Modules are 192.168.1.xxx

Now ### 192.168.1.xxx

AgIO Basics: https://youtu.be/Rx-ymbssRGE - is outdated for the .5 part.

VTG is NOT required to be sent anymore. Speed is derived from fix to fix distance.

Release 5.4.4

Context sensitive help for many buttons and features.

Several bug fixes.

Release 5.4.2

Most current release as of Nov 15, 2021

thinking the pixel is a flag. An important fix.

Update AgIO to work with new Septentrio Firmware. 02 August 2021

AgOpenGPS v5.2.1

Lightbar active all the time whenever a guidance line is active
Steer switch updated ever 1/2 second.
GGA Interval default set to 10 seconds

AgOpenGPS v5.1.5

This version is an attempt to fix delays some people are experiencing. 
All i can suggest is give it a try. What it does is limit the number of 
NMEA sentences to 10 hz instead of allowing many sentences that may have
accumulated due to windows being busy and then overloading AOG by making a 
zillion frame updates. They are simply dropped.

KML now has RecPath, Zoom buttons fixed. Rate Controller is now in support.

AgOpenGPS v4.3.10

On the plus side, unlike v4.1 or v4.2 - this one mostly works. 
Stop using those old v4's, they have many bugs.

Run "Add or Remove Programs" In Windows Settings and uninstall AgOpenGPS.
Install new Version. You must install the matching Arduino code.
Update June 15, 2020 - Overshoot reduction setting wasn't being saved locally.

Update May 21, 2020 - Format field size, added area/hr rate, 
x track error in inches in imperial, new section graphics, 
added offset to boundary recorder form, NEWS angles added to AB Form. 
Fixed also the uturn distance limitation. Same version number so it will use 
all your old settings.

Update May 6, 2020 - Keypad.DLL copied on update now. 
In Boundary when you click google earth the boundary form closes.
Color has a cancel button now.

This version needs you to set everything, and make new environment, 
tool, and vehicle settings - yes again...

NMEALog.txt is in the main Fields directory. It records all the NMEA all the 
time and appends to existing file - so it will make a huge file if you 
leave it on. Move and rename if you want to keep.

AgOpenGPS v4.1.12

4 April 2020 - AgOpenGPS - minor update and fixes. V4.1.12

NTRIP fixes, Able to select the mount from Source Data

Support files contain Arduino and PCB code.

AgOpenGPS v4.1.1

Update includes Autosteer INO files and installer for Application.

Arvel installs Software and Firmware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic4BtOzBtkk

April 2, 2020 Arduino code and AgOpenGPS

April 3: Encoder changed to Turn Sensor AgOpenGPS.msi

"Encoder" is now called Turn Sensor for detecting steering wheel turns.
NTRIP Source data is displayed for a caster as well as closest one of 
all casters
Auto/Manual autosteer button is now Remote/Manual - controlled by steer 
switch if in Remote

Be sure to watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNqwzcfyq-8

AgOpenGPS v4.1

AgOpenGPS_v4.msi - The installer, run this to install
Support_Files.Zip - Contains the all the Arduino code and PCB files - 
26 Mar 2020

This version will ignore all previous settings from v4.0 that was used 
to test and debug.
Previous fields made with v3 will not have mapping loaded in this version.

** Highly recommended to download ***

AgOpenGPS v4

Special notes if still using v3

v4 will not import existing section mapping from v3 fields.
v4 will not load vehicles from v3, now there are vehicles, tools, and 
environments that can be saved.
Be sure to upload the new sketch to the arduino - really important. 
All steer boards are compatible.
There may be some bugs, please report on the forum, and we'll get this one 
working well.

The AgOpenGPS.msi will install the program as well as put the arduino code 
on the desktop. The zipped version has program code for you to 
put where you wish.

Fixes:
Icon for program
Fix dual antenna roll logic for sidehill only.

AgOpenGPS v9 Overlap Edition

This version adds overlap calculation so you know exactly how much of your 
previous applying is overlapped. Can work with or without a boundary.

The installer can now put a directory of support files for arduino and 
pcb right on the desktop so you don't have to get the source code any longer.

AgOpenGPS v3.0.8
Pre-release

This is a pre-release version for a few days until a few people have made 
sure there aren't too bugs. Keep the old version for now and 
please test this one.

New features and text. Also now uses an installer, simply run the msi 
installer and the icon will appear on the desktop.

*** Installer on hold till ErrorLog.txt issue is fixed

*** Installer is back.

There also is the zip file of the program directory like the old way. 
Really good idea to delete your AppData\AgOpenGPS\ folder of config files 
and start fresh.

AgOpenGPS v3.0.7

Few bugs fixed, mainly the opengl window for sections gets messed up, 
the sizing of it all on its own - a microsoft feature!

AgOpenGPS

Old and the new. This is version 3.0.3 with the new GUI. 
Will be much more careful going forward with changes.

v3.0.3
AgOpenGPS
